<!-- Describe task in general -->
<div class="story for_info_only">
<p> - Chief, we have a new flight schedule. It just require your signature and we are ready to launch.</p>

<p> - Wow, so many planes! I’d like to make sure that we really need so many of them.</p>

<p> - Of course.</p> 

<p> - Let’s check!</p>
</div>

<p>This task is a continuation of the <a href="/mission/the-cheapest-flight/">“Cheapest Flights”</a> mission.</p>

<p>Here you have a flight schedule by which you need to find out whether all flights are really necessary.</p>

<p>For example: If from the point A to point C you can fly directly for $ 100, but you can also go through the point B (from A to B, and then from B to C) for $ 90, then connection A – C isn’t really needed. But if the price from A to C is $ 90 or less, then this connection remains on the schedule.</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> An array of all possible connections. Each element in the array is also an array of 3 elements: the first city, second city and flight price.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> An array of the unnecessary flight indices.
</p>
